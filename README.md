## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  I cant wait to do the other parts in onshape.

## Mount

### Description
The second assignment is the mount you have to use milimeters in this part. You make 120 milimeters on one side than 60 on the other and 200 on the last one put holes with the dimesions in it. Then you extrude cut it throygh all all the circles. Then you go to your base and put the mount and base part  to together then add varbles. Then you want to extrude cut through both parts of every hole that you made.
